\begin{frame}   \frametitle{What is the problem?}
  \begin{block}{Do pro athletes party to the detriment of their performance?}     It's not unreasonable to think that what happens off the court affects game-outcomes, but!
    \begin{itemize}       
      \item Can we even measure these phenomena?
      \item Are there systematic tendencies?
    \end{itemize}       \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}   
  \frametitle{Why is this important?}
  \begin{block}{\$400 billion spent on sports betting per year in the US.\footnote{NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, 2014.}}

    Apparently, a lot of people. Aside from bettors...
  \end{block}

  \vspace{12pt}\begin{block}{The causal relationship might inform more optimal strategy.}     For example,
    % Even aside from bettors, knowing the causal relation between % partying and next-day performance might inform
    \begin{itemize}       
      \item how coaches set team-rules, 
      \item how managers determine travel schedules, as well as
      \item which players to bench, and when.\footnote{Are players more likely to get injured the next day as a result of partying?}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}   
  \frametitle{Why is this problem hard?}
  \begin{block}{Partying is a latent variable.}
    Instead, we proxy for the possibility of athletes partying by looking at 
    play following games in party cities.
  \end{block}
  \vspace{12pt}\begin{block}{Part of the question is determining a measure for nightlife. }
    We dub cities with high levels of nightlife ``party cities''.  
  \vspace{12pt}
  \begin{block}{Another is how to measure a dip in performance?}
    We need to consider player ability, team momentum, etc.
  \end{block} \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{What's the specific question, exactly?}
  \begin{block}{Do teams/athletes perform worse the day after playing in a party-oriented city?}
\vspace{12pt}     I.e. we are concerned with ``hangover effects''.

\vspace{12pt}

% E.g. a team visits Las Vegas for the day. How is their next game?
  \end{block}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{How can we measure unexpected changes in performance?}     
  \begin{block}{Bookmaker point-spreads (NBA)}     
    The expected score differential between two teams.

    Conditions on (almost) every conceivable element of the game:
    \begin{itemize}     
      \item strengths and weaknesses against particular opponents,
      \item momentum,
      \item injuries, and
      \item even possibly a weather forecast (for outdoor sports).     
    \end{itemize}

    A team is expected to meet the spread $\frac{1}{2}$ the time.\footnote{Dubner and Levitt, ('06). Losers pay 10\% fee on top of wagers; a balanced book guarantees 5\% gain for the house-bookmaker.}
  \end{block}
  \vspace{12pt}
  \begin{block}{Bookmaker money-lines (MLB)}     
    The odds that a team will beat their opponent.

    After conditioning on odds, successful prediction is like a coin-flip. 
  \end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Our solution: a quasi-experiment.}
  \begin{block}{Systematic deviations represent unexplained mechanisms.}     We construct a model which attempts to estimate the causal effect of visiting a ``party city''
    on subsequent day performance, as measured by the odds of meeting the spread.       \end{block}

  \begin{block}{}     We only consider the hangover effect on games played back-to-back within 24 hours of each other.   
  \end{block} 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Identifying variation}
  \begin{block}{Performance as a function of previous day's nightlife index.}     If next day opponent is uncorrelated with visitation to a party city,
    then looking at the \emph{actual outcome} of the game $\leadsto$ identification.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Weakening our assumptions}
  \begin{block}{With some correlation between next-day opponent, this further motivates using bookmaker expectations as the response.}
    
    Helps to account for systematically running into teams the day after visitation to 
    a party oriented city who are particularly (not)-skilled.\footnote{Given the size of the market, this is reasonable.}
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Implications and pitfalls of using a black-box feature}
  \begin{block}{If bookkeepers aware of hangover effects...}     then our variable of interest may not appear significant, in spite of there being a true effect.   \end{block}
  \vspace{12pt}
  \begin{block}{If bookkeepers systematically mis-value teams...}
     which are more likely to be encountered after visiting a city with active nightlife, we could see a spurious effect.

      (Given size of betting market, this is unlikely)

  %   \begin{itemize}       \item Do teams play worse the day after visiting a ``party city''?
  %     \item How do we even determine whether a city has nightlife?    
  %     \item What does it mean to ``play worse''? \end{itemize}

  % \vspace{12pt}We define ``play worse'' relative to bookmaker/public expectations.

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Anecdotal evidence: players do party}
  \begin{block}{Open attitude toward partying}     Matt Barnes recently complained, ``there's no nightlife in Utah'' when asked
    about playing the Jazz in the 2017 playoffs.\footnote{Cestone and Seiter ('17).}   \end{block}

  \vspace{12pt}
  \begin{block}{Blaming the party scene for poor performance}
    J.R. Smith's career-to-date success rate of shots taken was 42\%, 
    but on Sunday afternoon games he only managed 34\% in 2012-13.\footnote{Concepcion ('15).}

    \vspace{12pt}
    After being traded from NY to Cavaliers, performance increased.
    When asked why: ``There’s nothing you expect (in Cleveland) but basketball. 
    There’s nothing, there’s no going out, there’s no late nights.''\footnote{Price, Levy ('15).}
  \end{block} 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Previous research - NBA player shooting average}
  \begin{block}{Empirical evidence: players party to the detriment of the game.}
  NBA Players under-perform proportion of shots made on Sundays.\footnote{Chase, ('15).}
  \end{block}
    \begin{itemize}       
    \item 1,092 of 2,035 NBA players who took $\geq 1$ shot on Sundays       under-perform 
      relative to their own career-long average;\footnote{Analysis limited to all players who entered the league after 1974.} $p=0.001$.
    \end{itemize}
    \begin{block}{Problems}       \begin{itemize}           \item Effect size is not considered.
          \item Density of support is questionable.\footnote{What if we miss the only shot we took on Sunday, is that relevant?}            \end{itemize}     \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Prev. research - likelihood of meeting the spread in NBA}
  \begin{block}{Empirical evidence: away teams under-perform on Sundays.}
  Teams under-perform bookmakers expectations on Sunday afternoons when on the road.\footnote{Ezekowitz, ('14).}
    \begin{itemize}       
    \item Only 129 out of 284 games did the away team meet the spread, 
      using 2006-14 data; $p=0.1089$.
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{12pt}
    \begin{block}{Only consider Sunday games $\leadsto$ underwhelming results:}       \begin{itemize}
          \item Not quite significant at the 90\% confidence level.     
          \item If we bet \$100 on each Sunday game, we'd only profit \$1,310 over 8 years.\footnote{$(284 - 129) \times 100 + 129 \times (-110) = 1,310$.} 
      \end{itemize}     \end{block}

%   \frametitle{Is the problem hard?}

%   \begin{block}{Finding causal-mechanisms which significantly determine % game-outcomes is difficult.}       It's not obvious whether we will find an % effect. 

%       \vspace{12pt}After all, we can't reliably observe if players party, let % alone when.

%       Even if we could, can we exploit this in the marketplace?   \end{block}

% \end{frame}


% \begin{frame}   \frametitle{Our solution: a quasi-experiment}
%   Consider games played back-to-back within 24 hours.  
  
%   \vspace{12pt}
%   Examine whether spread is met as a function of nightlife index for lagged game % location.

%   \vspace{12pt} (Alcohol and loss of sleep are well correlated with nightlife; % both have been shown to have negative effects on sports % performance.)\footnote{Shirreffs and Maughan ('06), Barnes ('14), Pilcher and % Huffcutt ('96).} \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Returning to our question within the NBA and MLB}
  \begin{block}{We perform the analysis for both NBA and MLB}     
    If we observe a team traveling to a city with active nightlife:
    \vspace{12pt}
    \begin{itemize}       \item For NBA teams playing another game in the next 24 hours, are they less likely to meet the points-spread?
      \item For MLB teams, after conditioning on the odds of winning, are they less likely to beat their next opponent?     \end{itemize}
    \vspace{12pt}\begin{block}{If we yield a causal model, we may realize a betting schema.}
\end{block}
  \end{block} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Public scrutiny makes data collection difficult}

  \begin{block}{Whether parties take place is a latent variable}     Due to intense public scrutiny, there is a reluctance to share nightlife experiences
    of players on social media.

  \end{block} 
  \vspace{12pt}
  \begin{block}{We can't observe when players go for a night on the town.}
    
    Instead, we develop two approaches to proxy for partying. 

    A discrete indicator and a continuous measure.
  \end{block} \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Discrete indicator}
  \begin{block}{Anecdotally, LA and NY appear in news articles frequently.}     \vspace{12pt}This motivates a binary indicator for party when either of these two cities have been visited within 24-hours of another game.
\vspace{12pt}
    \[
      \texttt{party} \coloneqq \mathbbm 1 \left \{\substack{\textrm{last game played in LA or NY} \\ \textrm{at most 24-hours ago}}\right \}
    \]   \end{block} 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}   
  \frametitle{Travel distance comparison}
  \centering \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{../writing/travel_dist_density_by_party} 
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Continuous measure}
  \begin{block}{A-list celebrities tend to party with other celebrities.}     Idea: proxy nightlife using number of musicians in previous location

    \[
      \texttt{party} \coloneqq \begin{cases}       \log \left(\# \textrm{musical groups}\right) &\substack{\textrm{ if last game played} \\ \textrm{at most 24-hours ago,}} \\
      0 &\textrm{ otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
    \]
    \newline
    Specifically, we consider the sum total of
    \[
      \textrm{Sound recording studios } + \textrm{ musical groups } + \textrm{ musical publishers}.
    \]   \end{block} \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   
  \frametitle{Continuous measure of party}
  \centering \includegraphics[scale=0.375]{../writing/Party_by_Team_Location} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{NBA data: 2010-11 through 2016-17 season}
  \begin{itemize}     \item Each team plays 82 games per season.
    \item 30 teams in the NBA.
    \item Total of $82 \times 30 / 2 = 1,230$ games per season.  
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{12pt}We query \href{http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/}{basketball-reference.com}
  for a listing of game-days, and then 
  \href{http://www.covers.com/sports/NBA/matchups?selectedDate=2011-1-01}{covers.com} for 
  game-outcomes alongside a point-spread.

  \vspace{12pt}  
  \begin{itemize}     \item Missing the first couple months of 2010-11 season.
    \item At most two missing games in each of remaining seasons.
    \item Total of 7,829 games in our dataset.   \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{MLB data: 2011 through 2017 season}
  \begin{itemize}     \item Each team plays 162 games per season.
    \item 30 teams in the MLB.
    \item Total of $162 \times 30 / 2 = 2,430$ games per season.   \end{itemize}
  
  \vspace{12pt}We query \href{http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/}{baseball-reference.com}
  for a listing of game days, and again look to covers.com for game-outcomes and money-lines.
  
  \vspace{12pt}
  \begin{itemize}     \item We have on average 2,100 games per season.
    \item (Missing observations due to broken links, postponed games?)
    \item Total of 12,709 games in our dataset.    \end{itemize} \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Bureau of Labor Statistics data: 2010-2016}
  We look toward BLS data which describes the number of business establishments 
  (of a very particular type) in each metropolitan statistical area
  for each quarter of each year.
  
  \vspace{12pt}  All teams are in the US with the exception of 
  \vspace{12pt}\begin{itemize}     \item Toronto Raptors (NBA)
    \item Toronto Blue Jays (MLB)   \end{itemize} 

  \vspace{12pt}These two teams are excluded from our analysis.\footnote{We don't expect Toronto to be a huge party city.} \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Minutes data for NBA}
  For NBA, we also collect minutes data from ESPN, which describes the number of 
  \vspace{12pt}
  \begin{itemize}     
    \item Free-throws
    \item Field goals
    \item Three-pointers   
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{12pt}attempted and made by each player in each game. For each season and each team,
  we have nearly complete minutes data; 85\% of our season-teams have no more than 3 missing games. \end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Possible confounders}
  What might influence game-outcomes apart from player-ability?

  \vspace{12pt}\begin{itemize}     
    \item Home team effect
    \item Fatigue from previous game
    \item Jet lag   
    \end{itemize}

  \vspace{12pt}The benefit of using spread data is that it controls for salient factors which affect game-outcomes.
  The downside is that we don't know exactly what it controls for. \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Feature creation}
  We add features which describe
  \vspace{12pt}  
  \begin{itemize}     
    \item Number of days since the last game (i.e. rest-time),
    \item Lagged changes in possession,\footnote{A crude measure of fatigue incurred from last game.}
    \item Lagged game location, and
    \item Travel Distance.   
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{12pt}We seek to construct a model which accounts for travel-fatigue and jet-lag.
  For this, we need a little bit more. \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Accounting for jetlag}
  Prolonged air travel negatively effects sporting performance.\footnote{Lee and Galvez ('12).}

  \vspace{12pt}In order to account for jet-lag, we need to be mindful of the direction of travel. We calculate
  \vspace{12pt}\begin{itemize}     \item distance traveled between games,
    \item final direction (bearing) traveling from $a \leadsto b$, and
    \item direction of travel (in east-west degrees) by taking sine.
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{12pt}Finally, to account for jetlag we interact this east-west measure with travel distance.\footnote{Lallensack ('17)} \end{frame}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Interpreting our results}
  Let's consider the simplest model, where $Y_i | X \sim \textrm{Bern}(p)$, i.e.
  $\Pr(Y_i = y | X) = p^{y} (1-p)^{1-y}$. Using a generalized linear model,
  we fit a linear predictor to a transformation of the expected value of our
  variable of interest. I.e.
  \[
    \textrm{logit} \left( \mathbb E[Y_i | X_i]\right) = \textrm{logit} \left(p\right) = \ln \left( \frac{p}{1-p}\right) = X_i^T \beta.
  \]
  So, we interpret our regression coefficient as follows: visiting LA or NY within
  24 hours of another game corresponds to being $e^{\beta_1} \approx e^{-0.55} \approx \frac{3}{5}$
  as likely to meet the spread, all other factors held constant.

  The same analysis can be replicated for MLB. Notable differences:
  \vspace{12pt}  
  \begin{itemize}     
    \item Money-lines are used instead of point-spreads. 
      So instead of predicting likelihood of meeting the spread,
      we predict likelihood of winning conditional on bookmakers odds.
    \item We interact our measure of nightlife with a weekend indicator.
    \item Games are played in series, so we no longer have the problem of an unknown travel schedule, i.e. players stay overnight in the same location within a series.   \end{itemize} \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Validating our model in the market}
  Our results are statistically significant, but so what? We validate our model by seeing
  how well we fare against the market.

  \begin{itemize}     \item We hold out data for validation.
    \item For each unseen relevant game, we place a bet of \$100 if the expected value of the bet
      is positive after accounting for bookmakers cut (\$10)
    \item Are we profitable?

  We additionally look toward actual performance metrics, instead of relying on point-spread data.
  
  \vspace{12pt}
  \begin{itemize}     
    \item Avoid using black-box feature
    \item Pinpoint more precisely what elements of game-play are affected by nightlife visitation.   
\end{itemize}

  \begin{block}{Is it the case the hangover effects are more prevalent on defensive aspects of gameplay?}     Anecdotally, rebounds are considered a ``hustle'' statistic, in the sense that players
    who work harder on the court and expend energy boxing out other players will have higher
    rebound rates.    \end{block}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Future research - NBA}
  Within the NBA
  \begin{itemize}     
    \item Are teams more likely to party after a win or a       loss?
    \item Do teams who aren't going to make the playoffs party more?
    \item Are there demographic differences which influence propensity to party? E.g. are younger, unmarried players more susceptible to our treatment effect?
    \item We could also examine how shots taken vs. shots scored are affected for star players.
  \end{itemize}
  \vspace{12pt}  A preliminary and ad-hoc analysis shows that injury risk increases as a function of party.\footnote{We look for instances where players are put on the bench and stop playing (at least several) games as a function of our nightlife indicator.}
  This might inform coaches which players to bench and when.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Future research (MLB and general)}
  \begin{itemize}     
  \item Within the MLB, we can look at statistics such as batting averages or general fielding statistics. 
    \item Possibly prolonged effects; recall our magic 24 hour number.
    \item NHL or European soccer leagues.   \end{itemize} \end{frame}

\begin{frame}   \frametitle{Conclusions}
  \begin{itemize}     \item NBA and MLB players under-perform bookmakers expectations after visiting LA and NY.
    \item In general we see that performance decreases as a function of (our proxy for) nightlife.     \item The decrease in likelihood can (in part) be explained by a drop in defensive performance in the NBA.
    \item With a causal model established, we realize a profitable betting scheme in MLB.   \end{itemize} \end{frame}
