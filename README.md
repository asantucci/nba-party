## The question
When teams from (small, or non-party) cities have an away game in a (large, or party) city, is there a causal effect which results in decreased performance during the following day?
To tease this out, we consider the following.

- Declare Los Angeles, Miami, and Brooklyn as "party" cities.
- Look for other teams who travel to one of the above party cities, and then also play a game in *another* city on the following day.
- If we look at performance against the spread in the following game, we can suss out a causal effect.
