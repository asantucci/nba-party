\section{Introduction}
It's not unreasonable to think that game performance can be affected 
(in part) by what takes place off the court. 
Anecdotally, it has been reported that professional sports teams party on 
the road, sometimes to the detriment of the game.\cite{hoch}
Within the NBA, J.R. Smith is infamous for citing his improvement in performance due to a
lack of nightlife when moving to Cleveland from New York.\cite{price,ley}
A few interviews with former professional athletes revealed that location
matters more than day of the week, i.e. parties can happen any day of the week,
but they are more likely to occur in select cities.

We are interested to see if 
teams exhibit a decline in performance the day following a game in a city 
with active nightlife. We exploit data on bookmaker spreads, the expected score 
differential between two teams after conditioning on observable performance. 
We expect a team to meet the spread half the time, since this is how bookmakers 
minimize risk on their end. We construct a model which attempts to 
estimate the causal effect of  visiting a ``party-city'' on subsequent day 
performance as measured by the spread. Since next-day
opponent is uncorrelated with exposure to treatment, we have identification in our variable of 
interest.

\section{Previous Research}
There has been an attempt to answer this question before.\cite{ezekowitz} 
However, the study only
looks at performance in party cities, as opposed to subsequent day performance (i.e. the study does not consider a delayed hangover effect). Moreover, their sample size was much smaller. 
Finally, there was no methodology used behind the selection of party cities. The author does conclude
that teams systematically play worse on Sunday afternoons when on the road,
regardless of cities.

Studies have also been carried out on statistical ranking of the players
most notorious for pursuing active nightlife in the NBA.\cite{chase} The study
does conclude that players perform worse on Sundays when compared with other days
as measured by the ratio of shots scored to shots taken.

Studies on effects of alcohol on sports performance in a controlled setting
show that alcohol impairs the nervous system, resulting in decrements in both
cognitive function and motor skill.\cite{shirreffs} In a study on 
the effects of alcohol on recovery of male athletes, it was found that
consumption is correlated with reduced production of testosterone
which ultimately leads to inhibited ability to recover and adapt to exercise.\cite{mjbarnes}
Sleep deprivation has also been shown to strongly impair cognitive and motor performance.\cite{pilcher} Both alcohol and sleep deprivation are well correlated with lifestyles associated
with an active night life.

\section{Materials and Methods}
One of the hardest parts of this analysis is that partying is a latent variable.
In order to determine when players partied, one might consider to look at social media data
for direct mentions of partying, either by athletes or witnesses. However, due to
intense public scrutiny that athletes face, there is a strong reluctance to post
such mentions on social media. There are notable exceptions, such
as Oddel Beckham Jr.'s trip to Miami in 2017 season.\cite{bleler}
The reports are few and far enough between,
and whether they are even reported at all is strongly biased on whether a particular city 
has nightclubs with VIP rooms, etc; picking up statistical evidence would be fruitless in this case.

\paragraph{Two approaches: a discrete indicator and a continuous measure of nightlife}
Because famous athletes often enjoy a celebrity lifestyle, using conventional statistics
such as number of drinking establishments in each city does not work; athletes instead
tend to visit high end nightclubs. We again turned to player interviews for ideas,
and found two major insights. From our conversations, 
we obtained a listing of cities which were anecdotally
mentioned as having active night-life. Between players, the rank ordering of these
was consistent to the extent that LA and NY were top
offenders. This motivates using a binary indicator for party in these two cities. 
We also found that athletes tend to party with other A-list celebrities,
particularly musicians. This motivated a continuous measure of nightlife, based on a
simple count of the number of musicians in the county in which the stadium resides. 
We pursue both approaches.


\paragraph{Logic for using spread data}
In order to assert a causal relation between cities with active nightlife 
and subsequent day sports performance, we need to control for salient
features such as the ability of players on either team in the match-up,
whether any players are injured, the momentum of success each team is carrying
in the season, etc.\cite{anderson} To that end, we utilize spread data. The benefit of
using spread data is that it controls for a lot, but the downside is that
we don't know exactly what it controls for.

For example, if book-keepers
are already aware of the effects of night-life on performance, it could
already be factored into the spread; if this were the case, then our variable
of interest would not appear to have significant explanatory power
after conditioning on spread, in spite of there being
a true effect. Alternatively,
if the house book-keeper systematically over-valued
teams which you are more likely to play after a party city,
we could see a spurious effect. 
That said, the amount of money that is at stake and the effort put into creating these spreads 
suggests that they are reliable. So, if we do find an effect in our variable of interest,
we can be confident in our conclusion that there is a causal effect and not some
other systematic bias.

\subsection{Possible confounders}

\paragraph{Home team effect}
Home-team advantage is well-studied.\cite{jones07, jones08}  
Because teams play a lot of their games on the road,
most games after playing in a party city will be an away game.
This should be covered by spread data, but we also include
a home-team indicator to be sure.

\paragraph{Fatigue from previous game}
What if we pick up effects of a busy play schedule?
Aside from accounting for how much rest time a team is allowed in between games,
we're also interested to get a measure of
fatigue incurred on the court.
We account for this by bringing in minutes data, and counting the number of 
times the players run back and forth on the court. This is crudely measured
by the number of changes in posession. We back out this quantity.

\paragraph{Fatigue from Jet lag}
What about jet-lag? Prolonged air travel has in general been shown
to have a negative effect on sports performance.\cite{leeandgalvez}
Previous studies have shown that jet lag is a strong enough effect
to erase home field advantage in MLB.\cite{songetal}

\paragraph{The problem of an unknown travel schedule} In NBA, we have the difficulty of not observing when teams travel. E.g. if a particular team  plays
in Los Angeles on Friday and another game in New York the following day, we don't
know whether the team traveled on Friday evening or Saturday morning. Heuristics for
travel schedules can be made, but it is hard to obtain reliable team-travel data.
In MLB, on the other hand, each match-up is actually a series of games. E.g.
if the Dodgers play the Giants in San Francisco, they will play several games spread
across several days, each in the same city; in these cases, we can infer that the team
is in fact spending the night in said city.


\subsection{Data}
\paragraph{Lines data} We first look toward 
\href{http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/}{basketball-reference.com}
for a listing of game-days by season. With this listing, we queried \href{http://www.covers.com/sports/NBA/matchups?selectedDate=2011-1-01}{covers.com},
for all games occurring on a particular game, and for each we observe
outcome of each game alongside the line set by a betting house. We obtain
data for seasons 2010-11 through 2016-17.


\paragraph{BLS data} We also obtained data from
\href{https://www.bls.gov/data/}{Bureau of Labor Statistics} which records the number of establishments by business type at the county-quarter level. As a 
proxy for how much night-life there is in a city, we look toward the 
number of sound recording studios, musical groups, and music publishers there 
are for a particular county-year: we simply calculate the average number of establishments across all three music categories listed above. We caveat that since the Toronto Raptors are located in Canada, we don't have BLS data for this team.

We then merge this in with our lines data, taking care to do so according to each season-team's last game location such that the feature captures the proper
party effect. In addition, we lag our BLS data by one year for two reasons:
realistically, player expectations of which cities have the most active night-life may not
update in real-time and also doing so allows us to create a betting model, i.e.
we don't rely on any features we can't obtain before making a game-time prediction. 
To this data, we've created features such as 
the number of days since last game, the last game location, and the travel distance. 

\paragraph{Minutes data}
We also gathered minutes data from \href{http://www.espn.com/nba/scoreboard/_/date/}{ESPN}.
The minutes data also contain information on the number of free throws, field goals, and three pointers made and attempted by each player in each game.

\paragraph{Location and Travel Distance Data} We are also interested
to account for the effects of jet-lag. For each team, we queried
a maps search engine to obtain a longitude and latitude listing.\cite{ggmap}
For each pairwise set of coordinates, we calculated distance between the two
points.\cite{sp} To account for jet-lag, we first computed the final direction 
(bearing) when arriving at the 
second point after starting from the first and following the shortest path on a sphere 
(following a great circle), which yields a direction in degrees. 
We then obtain a measure for east-west travel by looking at the trigonometric-$\sin$ of this angle.
Interacting this with travel-distance gets us a measure of jetlag.\cite{lallensack}

\subsection{Method: Defining what it means for a city to have nightlife}
We have a free parameter: the time-window which we believe the hangover effect
to last. Suppose we only look toward games which have been played in a party
city at most 24 hours ago. We take care to ignore
teams playing in their own cities, i.e. if a team's last game was played in at home 
we say that they were not exposed to an exogenous shock in nightlife.

\paragraph{Discrete indicator}
Our first sanity check was to define an indicator variable for when a team plays in 
Los Angeles or New York within 24 hours of their current game, we indicate one, else zero. Anecdotally, these are mentioned as hot-spots for
nightlife.

\paragraph{Continuous measure}
We also defined a continuous measure of nightlife:
if the last game was played at most 24 hours ago, use the log of the average number
of musicians in last game location, else emit zero. Intuitively, this captures
how much nightlife there is in a city since musical performances are correlated
with parties, if not an essential feature.

\subsection{Model} We use a logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of meeting
the spread as a function of whether the team partied as well as controlling for other confounders
listed above. Our basic model is as follows.

\[
\texttt{meet spread} \,  \sim \, \substack{\texttt{days since} \\ \texttt{last game}} \, + \, \texttt{jetlag} \, + \, \substack{\texttt{home team} \\ \texttt{effect}} \, + \, \texttt{party}
\]

\section{Results}
\subsection{Using spread data}
We find that after accounting for player fatigue incurred during the last game, jetlag and travel fatigue, and recovery time, and home-team effect, that both our discrete indicator and continuous measure of party
have a statistically significant effect on likelihood of meeting the spread.


\subsection{Using performance statistics}
We additionally looked at actual performance metrics instead of relying on spread data. 
This allows us to avoid using a black-box feature, and also pin-point
more exactly what elements of the game are in fact effected after visiting a city with active 
nightlife. This motivates looking at number of points allowed, and number of points scored;
we also considered how rebounds, fouls, and even injuries might be explained (in part) by
a hangover effect.

In particular, we see that the average number of rebounds obtained per minute
of game-play does decrease as a function of being exposed to a city with active night-life.
The method was to first calculate for each player and each game the number of rebounds obtained
per minute of game-play. Then, we subtract from each observation the player's average number of rebounds per minute taken across the entire season.
This is an ad-hoc approach that cannot be used for betting, since at game-time we are relying on future data for use in our average statistic which we must calculate and sweep out from each observation.


\subsection{Robustness check}
As a robustness check, we verify that this phenomena persists in an entirely separate
sport with entirely different players. To that end, we look toward
Major League Baseball, which is also well set up for our quasi-experiment since
there are many games played back-to-back in the season (more in fact, than NBA).

In general, we can replicate our analysis, but there are also some notable differences.
In the MLB, money-lines
are used instead of point-spreads. So as opposed to predicting
the likelihood of meeting the spread, we predict the probability
a team would win against their opponent as both a function of the book-makers'
odds of winning and our party variable. 
Additionally, our methodology changes ever so slightly: when creating our
continuous measure of nightlife, we interact the variable with weekend. The logic
is that because there are so many more games played in MLB, the weekend effect is more salient.
One of the last major differences between NBA and MLB games is that MLB games
are played in series, so the same match-up repeated multiple times. This remedies
the problem of an unknown travel schedule we faced with NBA because we are sure 
teams stay overnight in the same location within a series.

\subsubsection{Betting performance}
We also validate our model by seeing how well we can perform against the
market.

    the betting house suggests. We account for the bookmaker's cut. E.g. in the early 2016 season,

\subsection{Extending the research}
We can also validate where points are lost in MLB in a similar way.
It would be interesting to look at number of shots taken, and number of shots taken by stars.
It's possible there are prolonged effects of partying, and applying some sort of kernel
on the number of hours played since the last game could be interesting. It could also be
that different (types of) teams or players are more or less susceptible to the effects
of night-life; this could be demographic characteristics such as age or marital status.
Future work may consider similar effects in European soccer leagues.


\section{Conclusions}
We do find that visiting a city with active nightlife the day before a game does have 
a statistically significant negative impact on a team's likelihood of meeting the spread in NBA.
The decline in likelihood to meet the spread is possibly caused by a lack of control over the ball,
since we also find that players capture less rebounds per minute of gameplay the day after
visiting a city with active nightlife. We verify that this phenomena persists across sport, and 
to that end look toward major league baseball money-lines. Using these, we back out gambling
house's estimate for the team's probability of winning the game, and after conditioning on this
we find that visiting a city with active nightlife the day before a game does negatively 
impact the team's likelihood of winning the game.
With a causal model established, we realize a profitable betting strategy in each year of testing.
