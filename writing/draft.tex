\section{Introduction}
It's not unreasonable to think that game performance can be affected 
(in part) by what takes place off the court. 
Anecdotally, it has been reported that professional sports teams party on 
the road, sometimes to the detriment of the game.
Within the NBA, the player J.R. Smith underwent a substantial improvement
in performance metrics after being traded from New York to Cleveland; when an interviewer
asked what contributed to this bump in statistics, he infamously replied
that in New York he would have been out partying, but because there's no nightlife
in Cleveland, he ends up hitting the gym.\cite{price,ley}
Matt Barnes recently complained that ``there's no nightlife in Utah'' when 
asked about playing Jazz in the second round of NBA playoffs in 2017.\cite{cestone}
A few interviews with former professional NBA athletes revealed that location
matters more than day of the week, i.e. parties can happen any day of the week,
but they are more likely to occur in select cities.

We are interested to see if 
teams exhibit a decline in performance the day following a game in a city 
with active nightlife. We exploit data on bookmaker spreads, the expected score 
differential between two teams after conditioning on observable performance. 
We expect a team to meet the spread half the time, since this is how bookmakers 
minimize risk on their end. We construct a model which attempts to 
estimate the causal effect of  visiting a ``party-city'' on subsequent day 
performance as measured by the spread. To the extent that next-day
opponent is uncorrelated with exposure to treatment, we have identification in our variable of interest.

\section{Previous Research}
There has been an attempt to answer this question before.\cite{ezekowitz} 
However, the study only
looks at performance in party cities, as opposed to subsequent day performance (i.e. the study does not consider a delayed hangover effect). Moreover, their sample size was much smaller. 
Finally, there was no methodology used behind the selection of party cities. The author does conclude
that teams systematically play worse on Sunday afternoons when on the road,
regardless of cities.

Studies have also been carried out on statistical ranking of the players
most notorious for pursuing active nightlife in the NBA.\cite{chase} The study
does conclude that players perform worse on Sundays when compared with other days
as measured by the ratio of shots scored to shots taken.

Studies on effects of alcohol on sports performance in a controlled setting
show that alcohol impairs the nervous system, resulting in decrements in both
cognitive function and motor skill.\cite{shirreffs} In a study on 
the effects of alcohol on recovery of male athletes, it was found that
consumption is correlated with reduced production of testosterone
which ultimately leads to inhibited ability to recover and adapt to exercise.\cite{mjbarnes}
Sleep deprivation has also been shown to strongly impair cognitive and motor performance.\cite{pilcher} Both alcohol and sleep deprivation are well correlated with nightlife.

\section{Materials and Methods}
One of the hardest parts of this analysis is that partying is a latent variable.
In order to determine when players partied, one may consider looking at social media data
for direct mentions of partying, either by athletes or witnesses. However, due to the
intense public scrutiny that athletes face, there is a strong reluctance to disclose
their personal lives on social media. There are notable exceptions, such
as Oddel Beckham Jr.'s recent trip to Miami.\cite{bleler}
However, these reports are few and far enough between that picking up statistical 
evidence would be fruitless.

\paragraph{Two approaches: a discrete indicator and a continuous measure of nightlife}
Because famous athletes often enjoy a celebrity lifestyle, using conventional statistics
such as number of drinking establishments in each city does not work; athletes instead
tend to visit high end nightclubs. We again turned to player interviews for ideas,
and found two major insights. From our conversations, 
we obtained a listing of cities which were anecdotally
mentioned as having active night-life. Between players, the rank ordering of these
was consistent to the extent that Los Angeles and New York city were top
offenders. This motivates using a binary indicator for party in these two cities. 
We also found that athletes tend to party with other A-list celebrities,
particularly musicians. This motivated a continuous measure of nightlife, based on a
simple count of the number of musicians in the county in which the stadium resides. 
We pursue both approaches.


\paragraph{Logic for using spread data}
In order to assert a causal relation between cities with active nightlife 
and subsequent day sports performance, we need to control for salient
features such as the ability of players on either team in the match-up,
whether any players are injured, the momentum of success each team is carrying
in the season, etc. To that end, we utilize spread data.\cite{anderson} The benefit of
using spread data is that it controls for a lot, but the downside is that
we don't know exactly what it controls for.

For example, if book-keepers
are already aware of the effects of night-life on performance, it could
already be factored into the spread; if this were the case, then our variable
of interest would not appear to have significant explanatory power
after conditioning on spread, in spite of there being
a true effect. Alternatively,
if the house book-keeper systematically mis-values
teams which are more likely to be encountered after playing a city with active nightlife,
we could see a spurious effect. 
That said, the amount of money that is at stake and the effort put into creating these spreads 
suggests that they are reasonably reliable. 
So, if we do find an effect in our variable of interest,
we can be reasonably confident in our conclusion that there is a causal effect and not some 
other systematic bias.

\subsection{Possible confounders}

\paragraph{Home team effect}
Home-team advantage is well-studied.\cite{jones07, jones08}  
Because teams play a lot of their games on the road,
most games after playing in a party city will be an away game.
This should be covered by spread data, but we also include
a home-team indicator to be sure.

\paragraph{Fatigue from previous game}
What if we pick up effects of a busy play schedule?
Aside from accounting for how much rest time a team is allowed in between games,
we're also interested to get a measure of
fatigue incurred on the court.
We account for this by bringing in minutes data, and counting the number of 
times the players run back and forth on the court. This is crudely measured
by the number of changes in posession. We back out this quantity.

\paragraph{Fatigue from jetlag}
What about jetlag? Prolonged air travel has in general been shown
to have a negative effect on sports performance.\cite{leeandgalvez}
Previous studies have shown that jetlag is a strong enough effect
to erase home field advantage in major league baseball, for example.\cite{songetal}

\paragraph{The problem of an unknown travel schedule} In NBA, we have the difficulty of not observing when teams travel. E.g. if a particular team  plays
in Los Angeles on Friday and another game in New York the following day, we don't
know whether the team traveled on Friday evening or Saturday morning and hence don't know
which city they ``visited'' on Friday night. Heuristics for
travel schedules can be made, but it is hard to obtain reliable team-travel data.
In MLB, on the other hand, each match-up is actually a series of games. E.g.
if the Dodgers play the Giants in San Francisco, they will play several games spread
across several days, each in the same city; in these cases, we can infer that the team
is in fact spending the night in said city.


\subsection{Data}
\paragraph{Lines data} We first look toward 
\href{http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/}{basketball-reference.com}
for a listing of game-days by season. With this listing, we queried \href{http://www.covers.com/sports/NBA/matchups?selectedDate=2011-1-01}{covers.com},
for all games occurring on a particular day, and for each we observe the
outcome of each game alongside the line set by a betting house. We interpret the lines
according to a standard guide.\cite{hrisports} We obtain
data for seasons 2010-11 through 2016-17. There are exactly 30 teams in the NBA,
each plays 82 games per season.
We are missing the first couple months of games 
in the 2010-11 season, and our 2011-12 season has 229 missing games. In each remaining
season, we have at most two games missing of the $82 \times 30 / 2 = 1,230$ played.
We have a total of 7,829 games in our data-set.


\paragraph{BLS data} We also obtained data from
\href{https://www.bls.gov/data/}{Bureau of Labor Statistics} which records the number of establishments by business type at the county-quarter level. As a 
proxy for how much night-life there is in a city, we look toward the 
number of sound recording studios, musical groups, and music publishers there 
are for a particular county-year: we simply calculate the average number of establishments across all three music categories listed above. We caveat that since the Toronto Raptors are located in Canada, we don't have BLS data for this team.

We then merge this in with our lines data, taking care to do so according to each season-team's last game location such that the feature captures the proper
party effect. In addition, we lag our BLS data by one year for two reasons:
realistically, player expectations of which cities have the most active night-life may not
update in real-time and also doing so allows us to create a betting model, i.e.
we don't rely on any features we can't obtain before making a game-time prediction. 
To this data, we've added features such as 
the number of days since last game, the last game location, and the travel distance. 

\paragraph{Minutes data}
We also gathered minutes data from \href{http://www.espn.com/nba/scoreboard/_/date/}{ESPN}.
The minutes data also contain information on the number of free throws, field goals, and three pointers made and attempted by each player in each game.

\paragraph{Location and Travel Distance Data} We are also interested
to account for the effects of jet-lag. For each team, we queried
a maps search engine to obtain a longitude and latitude describing their
stadium location.\cite{ggmap}
For each pairwise set of coordinates, we calculated distance between the two
points.\cite{sp} To account for jet-lag, we first computed the final direction 
(bearing) when arriving at the 
second point after starting from the first and following the shortest path on a sphere 
(following a great circle), which yields a direction in degrees. 
We then obtain a measure for east-west travel by looking at the trigonometric-$\sin$ of this angle after converting to radians.
Interacting this with travel-distance gets us a measure of jetlag.\cite{lallensack}

\subsection{Method: Defining what it means for a city to have nightlife}
We have a free parameter: the time-window which we believe the hangover effect
to last. We consider games which have been played at most 24 hours ago, and take care to ignore
teams playing in their own city, i.e. if a team's last game was played at home  we say that they were not exposed to an exogenous shock in nightlife.

\paragraph{Discrete indicator}
Our first sanity check was to define an indicator variable for when a team plays in 
Los Angeles or New York within 24 hours of their current game, we indicate one, else zero. Anecdotally, these are mentioned as hot-spots for
nightlife.

\paragraph{Continuous measure}
We also defined a continuous measure of nightlife:
if the last game was played at most 24 hours ago, use the log of the average number
of musicians in last game location, else emit zero. Intuitively, this captures
how much nightlife there is in a city since musical performances are correlated
with parties, if not an essential feature.

\subsection{Model} We use a logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of meeting
the spread as a function of whether the team partied as well as controlling for other confounders
listed above. Our basic model is as follows.

\[
\texttt{meet spread} \,  \sim \, \substack{\texttt{days since} \\ \texttt{last game}} \, + \, \texttt{jetlag} \, + \, \substack{\texttt{home team} \\ \texttt{effect}} \, + \, \texttt{party}
\]

\section{Results}
\subsection{Using spread data}
We find that after accounting for player fatigue incurred during the last game, jetlag and travel fatigue, recovery time, and home-team effect that both our discrete indicator and continuous measure of party
have a statistically significant effect on likelihood of meeting the spread.
In laymens terms, teams under perform book-maker's expectations after playing in cities 
with active nightlife.
This supports the hypothesis that players enjoy nightlife systematically in certain
cities and that a ``hangover'' effect is felt on the court the next day.

We mention that it's not surprising that features describing jet-lag and recovery time
are not significant: such salient information has already been taken into account in
setting the spread.
In the next section, we explore which specific areas of gameplay are affected.

\subsection{Using performance statistics}
We additionally looked at actual performance metrics instead of relying on spread data. 
This allows us to avoid using a black-box feature, and also pin-point
more precisely what elements of the game effected by visiting a nightlife city. This motivates looking at number of points allowed, and number of points scored; we also considered how rebounds, fouls, and even injuries might be 
explained (in part) by a hangover effect.

\paragraph{Rebounds: the ``hustle'' statistic}
In particular, we see that the average number of rebounds obtained per minute
of game-play does decrease as a function of being exposed to a city with active night-life. Rebounds are often considered a ``hustle-statistic'' in the sense 
that anecdotally, players who work harder on the court and expend energy boxing out
other players will have higher rebound rates. If this common knowledge is accepted,
our analysis suggests that players are working less hard following travel to a 
city with active nightlife.

The method was to first calculate for each player and each game the number of rebounds obtained
per minute of game-play. Then, we subtract from each observation the player's average number of rebounds per minute taken across the entire season.
This is an ad-hoc approach that cannot be used for betting, since at game-time we are relying on future data for use in our average statistic which we must calculate and sweep out from each observation.

\paragraph{The hangover correlates with allowing more points}
Similarly, common knowledge also suggests that the overall defense of a team
is effected strongly by individual player effort. It seems likely that a hangover effect
would be more prevalent on the defensive aspects of gameplay. To that end, we examine points allowed and points scored as a function of exposure to nightlife.
It's worth noting that travel to party cities is correlated with allowing
more points on the subsequent day of gameplay, but the null hypothesis
can't be rejected for points scored.

It's also interesting to see that after visiting LA or NY, for any given
team their next day performance is strongly correlated with allowing the other team to
score two and a half points more. 
It's even more interesting to note that points spreads are on a similar order of magnitude,  
i.e. this could often be the difference between meeting the spread or not.

\subsection{Robustness check}
As a robustness check, we verify that this phenomena persists in an entirely separate
sport with entirely different players. To that end, we look toward
Major League Baseball, which is also well set up for our quasi-experiment since
there are many games played back-to-back in the season (more in fact, than NBA).
There are also anecdotes of players celebrating with alcohol in public.\cite{miller,campbell}

In general, we can replicate our analysis and use the same resources to obtain our data,
 but there are also some notable differences.
In the MLB, money-lines
are used instead of point-spreads. So as opposed to predicting
the likelihood of meeting the spread, we predict the probability
a team would win as both a function of the book-makers'
odds of winning and our party variable. 
Additionally, our methodology changes ever so slightly: when creating our
continuous measure of nightlife, we interact the variable with weekend. Interviews with athletes suggest that MLB players are more likely to
restrict their partying to weekends.
One of the last major differences between NBA and MLB games is that MLB games
are played in series, so the same match-up is repeated multiple times. This remedies
the problem of an unknown travel schedule we faced with NBA because we are sure 
teams stay overnight in the same location within a series.

\begin{tabular}{@{\extracolsep{5pt}}lc}  \\[-1.8ex]\hline  \hline \\[-1.8ex]   & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{Dependent variable:}} \\  \cline{2-2}  \\[-1.8ex] & (team.score $ > $ opponent.score) \\  \hline \\[-1.8ex]   party & $-$0.035$^{*}$ (0.020) \\    odds & 2.602$^{***}$ (0.162) \\    I(team == location) & 0.025 (0.034) \\    ndays.lgame & 0.014 (0.019) \\    log(travel.dist + 1) & $-$0.001 (0.005) \\    weekend & 0.040 (0.036) \\    Constant & $-$1.331$^{***}$ (0.080) \\   \hline \\[-1.8ex]  Observations & 25,215 \\  Log Likelihood & $-$17,274.450 \\  Akaike Inf.

As shown above, our continuous measure of nightlife remains statistically significant.

\subsubsection{Betting performance}
We also validate our MLB model by seeing how well we can perform against the
market.
\begin{figure}[!h]

  \includegraphics{mlb_bets_by_season}
  \caption{Betting performance by season. In each season, The 
    circled point represents the worst out of pocket expense incurred.
    We first train a model on historical data then use said model to predict on ``current year''
    data, plotting profits as a function of time over the ``current'' season. For each relevant
    game, we place a bet of \$100 if the expected value of the bet is positive after accounting for the bookmaker's cut. E.g. in the     early 2016 season,
    at its worst we are out of pocket \$750 dollars. By season end, we have     recouped all of
    our initial investment plus an additional \$11.5k.}

\subsection{Extending the research}
\paragraph{Within the NBA} 
We're interested to explore what other factors may affect a team's propensity to suffer hangover effects beyond simply visiting a party city; e.g. are teams more likely to go out after
a win or a loss? Do teams who aren't going to make the playoffs party more? Are there demographic
factors which influence partying, e.g. are younger, unmarried players more susceptible to treatment effect? Within a game, it would be interesting to look at 
number of shots taken, and number of shots taken by 
stars as a function of previous day visitation to party cities. We could also investigate 
effects on injury risk and flagrant foul rates.

\paragraph{MLB}
It would also be interesting to examine the particular ways that partying
effects performance statistics similar to how we did with NBA.
We might consider whether batting performance (averages, slugging percentage)
pitching (ERA, WHIP) or general fielding stats are effected by party.

\paragraph{General}
In both sports, it's possible there are prolonged effects of partying, and applying some sort of kernel on the number of hours played since the last game could be interesting. 
Future work may consider similar effects in European soccer leagues.


\section{Conclusions}
We do find that visiting a city with active nightlife the day before a game does have 
a statistically significant negative impact on a team's likelihood of meeting the spread in NBA. This decreased likelihood to meet the spread may be explained 
by the team's defense letting up more points. In turn, we believe that the drop in
defensive performance may be caused by a drop in physical exertion.
We verify that this phenomena persists across sport, and 
to that end look toward major league baseball money-lines. Using these, we back out gambling
house's estimate for the team's probability of winning the game, and after conditioning on this
we find that visiting a city with active nightlife the day before a game does negatively 
impact the team's likelihood of winning.
With a causal model established, we realize a profitable betting strategy in each year of testing.
